Project I created to learn and get familiar with React and its core concepts, while also using libraries such as React Query and React Router. For authentication and authorization I used Supabase.

## Features

* Add to Watchlist: Easily add movies you want to watch to your watchlist.

* Watchlist Management: View and manage your watchlist by marking movies as favorites or removing them.
